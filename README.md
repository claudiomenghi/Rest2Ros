[PsAlMISt: Pattern bAsed MIssion Specifier](https://github.com/claudiomenghi/PsAlMISt) (a Java tool allows the specification of robotic missions)

### Usage

* Clone the repository in your catkin workspace <br/>
```git clone https://github.com/claudiomenghi/Rest2Ros.git```

* Compile your carkin workspace <br/>
```catkin_make```

* Source the workspace <br/>
```source devel/setup.bash```

* Run the `Rest2Ros` component <br/>
```roslaunch communication_manager communication_manager.launch```


### Changing the port and the type of the message generated
You can change the port and the type of the message generated by modifying the communication_manager.launch file in the launch folder

* ```<param name="port" value="13000" />``` contains the port upon which the server is running 

* ```<param name="topicName" value="local_mission" />``` contains the ROS topic upon which the received messages are published

* ```<param name="13001" value="13001" />``` contains the port upon which the publisher is running 

* ```<param name="forwardedtopics" value="mission_locations,mission_actions" />``` contains the topics forwarded by the publisher separated by comma



### Co4robots

- the server is running on port ```13000```
- the pubsub is running on port ```13001```

- the pubsub forwards messages on the topics ```mission_locations``` and ```mission_actions```

- the client forwards the received messages on local ros messages on the topic ```local_mission```
