How to run the two API's

Python API:
To run the python API import movement_master and image_master. There is a simple test of these files in "testing_getImage.py" to see how it works.
When the file movement_master has been imported you have the methods setSpeed and setAngle to work with. Set angle takes an angle in randians.
The image_master files gives you the method getImage which returns an image as a string array.

REST API:
To use the rest API start the file called "rest_python.py". It takes a parameter a port number, for example, "./rest_python 8886" will start the REST service on port 8886.
The file "rest_python.py" needs some permissions to run. Use the following command to get the permissions: "chmod +x rest_python.py".
To test the functions getImage and setSpeed/Angle once the server is running, do the following curl commands: 
curl localhost:<PORT> (returns an image)
curl -d "speed=2" localhost:<PORT> (set the speed to 2)
curl -d "angle=1.6" localhost:<PORT> (set the angle to ~90deg)
